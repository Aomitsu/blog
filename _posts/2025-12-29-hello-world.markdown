## Woahh !

Welcome to my blog! I've tried several times to start a blog, but unfortunately, I never managed to keep it going.
This time, I'm trying a different approach, with a blog that's a bit like my adventure in development.

I've been developing since I was a child. I started with PHP, then JavaScript, and Java. Today, I've been struck by the power of Rust, but I'm looking to learn new languages such as C, C++, and [Zig](https://ziglang.org/).

Despite my background, and as you can see on my [GitHub Account](https://github.com/Aomitsu), I don't consider myself a developer; I'm more of a hobbyist who enjoys himself.

In any case, welcome to my blog, make yourself comfortable!
